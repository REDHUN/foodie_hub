# Splash Screen Setup Instructions

## Overview
A beautiful full-screen animated splash screen has been added to your FoodieHub app with the following features:

- **Full Screen Display**: Covers entire screen including status bar and navigation bar
- **Gradient Background**: Beautiful orange-red gradient matching your app theme
- **Animated Logo**: Rotating and pulsing restaurant icon
- **Delivery Boy Image**: Placeholder for your delivery boy illustration with custom fallback
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade, scale, and slide transitions
- **Auto Navigation**: Automatically navigates to home screen after 3.5 seconds
- **Modern Flutter**: Uses latest Flutter APIs (withValues instead of deprecated withOpacity)

## Adding Your Delivery Boy Image

1. **Replace the placeholder image**:
   - Navigate to `assets/images/`
   - Replace `delivery_boy.png` with your actual delivery boy image
   - Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or higher
   - Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG

2. **Image Requirements**:
   - **Background**: Transparent PNG works best
   - **Style**: Cartoon/illustration style recommended
   - **Content**: Should show a delivery person with bike/scooter
   - **Colors**: Bright, friendly colors that match your app theme

## Customization Options

### Change Splash Duration
In `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`, modify line 67:
```dart
await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 3500)); // Change this value
```

### Modify Colors
Update the gradient colors in the Container decoration:
```dart
colors: [
  Color(0xFFFF6B6B), // Top color
  Color(0xFFFF8E53), // Middle color  
  Color(0xFFFF6B35), // Bottom color
],
```

### Change App Name/Tagline
Update the text widgets in the splash screen:
```dart
const Text(
  'FoodieHub', // Change app name here
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 36, ...),
),
Text(
  'Delicious food delivered fast', // Change tagline here
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 16, ...),
),
```

## Fallback Illustration
If no image is provided, the app will show a custom-drawn delivery boy illustration created with Flutter's CustomPainter. This ensures your app always looks professional even without a custom image.

## Files Modified
- `lib/main.dart` - Updated to show splash screen first
- `lib/screens/splash_screen.dart` - Main splash screen implementation
- `lib/widgets/animated_logo.dart` - Animated logo component
- `lib/widgets/delivery_boy_illustration.dart` - Custom fallback illustration
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added assets configuration
- `assets/images/delivery_boy.png` - Placeholder image (replace this!)

## Testing
Run your app to see the splash screen in action:
```bash
flutter run
```

The splash screen will show for 3.5 seconds with smooth animations before transitioning to your home screen.
